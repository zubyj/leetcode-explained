### Features

1️⃣ Solution videos: Adds the top 5 youtube solution videos into each [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions)

2️⃣ Company tags: Adds the top 5 companies that ask each [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description)

3️⃣ Problems by company
Click a company tag to view every question that company has asked in the past 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and all time. Sort by the date, acceptance rating, difficulty, and more.

4️⃣ Complexity Analysis
Reads your code and gets the time & space complexity using GPT

5️⃣ Code Generation
Reads your code, fixes bugs, and generates the optimal solution code for the given problem using GPT. For more accurate results, open the description tab so GPT can read the problem's description and constraints.

6️⃣ Elo ratings
Adds difficulty ratings into weekly/biweekly contest problems (~1500 added)

7️⃣ Hard Mode
Hide the Leetcode problem examples to simulate a real coding interview environment. Available through the extension's settings.

### 📚 Tutorial

For solution videos open a Leetcode problem's
[solutions tab](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions)

 If you pin the extension in the toolbar & login into ChatGPT in your browser, you can use the following 2 GPT buttons:

- Get your code complexity using ChatGPT
- Fix bugs in your code and return the optimal solution

Please ensure your Leetcode solution is open so the extension can read your code from the page.
